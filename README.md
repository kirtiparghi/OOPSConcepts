# OOPSConcepts
This repository contains different programs which demonstrate object oriented fundamentals listed below:
> Class
> Objects
> Inheritance
> Polymorphism
> Abstraction
> Encapsulation
> Association
> Aggregation
> Composition

Advantages of OOPS:
> OOP offers easy to understand and a clear modular structure for programs.
> Objects created for Object-Oriented Programs can be reused in other programs. Thus it saves significant development cost.
> Large programs are difficult to write, but if the development and designing team follow OOPS 
concept then they can better design with minimum flaws.
> It also enhances program modularity because every object exists independently.
